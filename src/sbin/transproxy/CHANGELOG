version 1.4 (5th Feb 2001)
	**	Fixed HTTPS proxy support. You can now point your browsers
	**	proxy configuration at transproxy and it will correctly
	**	process the CONNECT method.

version 1.3 (1st Oct 2000)
	**	Added support for passing HTTPS on to the proxy (untested).
	**	(Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@long.yar.ru>) Provide patch for
		IPTABLES as provided in the Linux 2.4 kernel.
	**	(Moisi Gabriela <mgabi@gabi.1a.ro>) Bug fix for closing sockets
		when connect(2) or bind(2) fails.
	**	Added the '-p' option to prevent fail-over to a transparent
		connection if the proxy connection fails.

version 1.2 (9th Feb 2000)
	**	(Oleg Bulavsky <bulch@sibnet.ru>) For Solaris: define INADDR_NONE,
		rename typedef of ipaddr_t to avoid clash. Enclose client_host
		declaration within LOG_TO_SYSLOG and LOG_TO_FILE conditional.
	**	(Oleg Bulavsky <bulch@sibnet.ru>) For Solaris: Some problem with
		the GNU Solaris development utilities prevents strchr(3) from
		compiling. So conditionally (-DUSE_STRSTR_BUG) use strstr(3).
	**	Cast isdigit parameters to an int to silence warnings.
	**	Fix incorrect port numner in README for FreeBSD ipfw commands.

version 1.1 (21st Sep 1999)
	**	(Vyacheslav Silakov <seal@nordlink.ru>) Provide for the case when
		a port number is contained in the Host: header.
	**	Fix problem with parsing data provided by POST method. The new
		HTTP/1.1 persistent connections parser broke the POST method.

version 1.0 (12th Jul 1999)
	**	Provide a robust method of reading HTTP requests. Should be
		fully compliant with HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. The log
		file includes the request number send over the same connection.
	**  Provide an access control list for restricting who is allowed
		access to the transparent proxy. This is much faster that using
		tcp_wrappers for this function.
	**	Allow tcp_wrappers as an alternative to provide host access control.
	**	Fixed up the remapping of a URL to a fixed location by allowing
		accesses to documents referred to by the fixed location. This should
		allow images and SSI cgi-bins to work.
	**	Transparent mode now directly contacts the original source rather
		than the proxy. This allows transproxy to function as a HTTP proxy
		on a firewall without a cache.
	**	Transproxy will now try to connect to the original source if it fails
		to connect to the cache proxy.
	**	Only allow server mode specific command-line switches when server
		mode has been enabled.
	**	Provided tproxyrun and tproxywatch as examples or usable scripts.

version 0.6 (28th Jun 1999)
	**	I have decided to use a BSD style COPYRIGHT rather than the
		FSF COPYLEFT. I feel that it is much less restrictive.
	**	Installed binary is now called tproxy instead of in.tproxyd.
	**	Log access to a file is now supported with the -l switch.
		See the make file for automatically opening the log file.
	**	(Bill 'Gates' Evans <evans@nasp.cnet.navy.mil>) Implemented
		a no-daemonise mode. With the -d switch tproxy doesn't go
		into the background. Usefull when running from inittab.

version 0.5 (25th Jun 1999)
	**	(Vesselin Atanasov <vesselin@bgnet.bg>) Implemented changes
		to lookup the proxy host for each request, hence allowing DNS
		round-robin load sharing.
	**	(Vesselin Atanasov <vesselin@bgnet.bg>) Included a patch
		(after coding standard changes) to fix operation with
		HTTP/1.1 persistent connections by forcing them to be disabled.
	**	Added some options to either disable syslog(3) logging,
		use it only for errors, or use it for everything. Check
		the Makefile.
	**	Some minor buglet fixes to operation under error conditions.
	**	(Krzysztof Adamski <kadamski@netsurf.net>) Added remapping of
		url to a fixed location.

version 0.4 (1st May 1998)
	**	Fix up README file bug about the /etc/services file entry.
	**	Applied BSD patches so that it works with the IP filter.
	**	Some errno.h and SIGCHLD changes to compile with other
		systems and the new linux glibc.

version 0.3 (6th May 1997)
	**	Use the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option to allow the TCP/IP
		layer to detect when a connection has gone away.

	**	Set an alarm for 5 minutes to detect an idle connection.

version 0.2 (18th Feb 1997)
	**	Parse the request headers looking for a "Host:" header to try
		and find the real host name the request was being sent to.
		When this works out it means no DNS lookups at all. More work
		needs to be done on reliably searching the headers.

	**	Use setuid/setgid instead of setreuid/setregid so that the
		saved uid and gid also get set.

	**	I found that if a set the SIGCLD singal to SIG_IGN then I
		don't have to worry about children or zombies!

Version 0.1 (16th Feb 1997)
	**	Initial version.
