.Sh NAME
.Nm pim6sd.conf
.Nd config file for pim6sd, PIM-SM daemon for IPv6
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated
by a semi-colon (`;'), each of which specifies how the daemon treats
each interface on the system, specifies some parameters of the PIM
protocol, and requires some special behavior defined by the protocol.
.Pp
Each statement can be constructed by multiple lines.
.Pp
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.\".Pp
.\"Note that
.\".Xr pim6sd 8
.\"works even without the configuration file, although the daemon
.\"will warn that there is no configuration file.
.\"In such a case, the daemon will automatically set the default value
.\"to each configurable parameter.
.\"
.Pp
The following statements can be specified in the configuration file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic log
.Ar option...
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specify debug messages to be printed out. Each
.Ar option
usually specifies a subset of the messages to be printed.
If an
.Ar option
begins with
.Ic no ,
it means that the set of the messages that are specified by the option
will not be printed. For example,
.Ic `all nomld'
means that all the messages except MLD related ones will be printed.
Valid options are
.Ic mld_proto, mld_timer, mld_member, mld, switch, trace, mtrace, traceroute,
.Ic timeout, callout, pkt, packets, interfaces, vif, kernel, cache, mfc,
.Ic k_cache, k_mfc, rsrr, pim_detail, pim_hello, pim_neighbors, pim_register,
.Ic registers, pim_join_prune, pim_j_p, pim_jp, pim_bootstrap, pim_bsr, bsr,
.Ic bootstrap, pim_asserts, pim_cand_rp, pim_c_rp, pim_rp, rp, pim_routes,
.Ic pim_routing, pim_mrt, pim_timers, pim_rpf, rpf, pim, routes, routing,
.Ic mrt, routers, mrouters, neighbors, timers, asserts,
and
.Ic all .
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic reverselookup (yes \(ba no);
.Xc
Specifies if a hostname for an IPv6 address should be resolved
on logging.
.Ic yes
means a hostname should be resolved, and
.Ic no
means should not.
By default, a hostname is not resolved.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic default_phyint_status (disable \(ba enable);
.Xc
Specifies
.Xr pim6sd 8
to enable or disable multicast routing, when it is not explicitly
configured in
.Ic phyint
statement.  By default,
.Ic enable
is assumed.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic phyint Ar interface Ic (disable \(ba enable);
.Xc
Specifies
.Xr pim6sd 8
to enable or disable multicast routing on the interface.
If none of them are specified,
.Ic default_phyint_status
statement determines whether multicast routing is enabled or disabled.
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar gif0
and
.Ar ep1.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic phyint Ar interface
.Op preference Ar preference
.Op metric Ar metric
.Op nolistener
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specifies the preference and/or metric values when sending a PIM
assert message on the interface.
If another optional parameter
.Ic nolistener
is specified,
.Xr pim6sd 8
will not send any MLD packets on the interface.
This option is usually meaningless but will be useful when
MLD messages are noisy (e.g. when debugging) and there is surely no
listner on the interface.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic phyint Ar interface
.Op llqi Ar n
.Op robustness Ar r
.Op query_rsp_interval Ar qri
.Op query_interval Ar qi
.Op mld_version Ar ver
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specifies MLDv2-specific parameters for the given interface. 
.Ic llqi
is used to specify last-listener-query-interval, and its default value is 1000ms.  
.Ic robustness 
is for robustness-variable for the interface and its default value is 2.
.Ic query_rsp_interval
and
.Ic query_interval
corresponds to query-response-interval and query-interval in MLDv2 Query 
message, and their default value is 10000ms (query_rsp_interval), and
125s (query_interval).
.Ic mld_version
is used to specify the acceptable version of MLD.  For example if it is 
configured as 1, then only MLDv1 packet is permitted on this interface.
If the argument is 
.Ic any
, then any version of MLD (currently v1 and v2) are permitted.  If you are
to enable MLDv1-compat-mode under MLDv2, you should specify
.Ic any
, since only MLDv2 packet is permitted if it is configured as 2.
Its default value is 1.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic default_source_preference Ar preference;
.Xc
Specifies a default preference value when sending a PIM assert message.
Preferences are used by assert elections to determine upstream routers.
Currently
.Xr pim6sd 8
does not have an effective method to obtain preferences and metrics from the
unicast routing protocols, so you may want to set a default value by hand.
The default preference is 1024.
.\"
.It Ic default_source_metric Ar metric;
Specifies a default metric value when sending a PIM assert message.
Since
.Xr pim6sd 8
cannot get an effective metric of unicast routing,
it is recommended that preferences is set such that metrics are never
consulted. However, default metrics may also be set, and
its default value is 1024.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic granularity Ar second;
.Xc
Specifies timer granularity in seconds.
The default value is 5.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic hello_period Ar period Ar coef;
.Xc
.Ar Period
specifies the period in second between 2 hello messages.
.Ar Coef
is the coefficient to determine the hello holdtime;
the holdtime will be
.Ar period
*
.Ar coef .
The default values of the period and the coefficient are 30 and 3.5,
respectively. The default holdtime is 105 seconds as a result.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic join_prune_period Ar period Ar coef;
.Xc
.Ar Period
specifies the period in second between 2 join/prune messages.
.Ar Coef
is the coefficient to determine the join/prune holdtime;
the holdtime will be
.Ar period
*
.Ar coef .
The default values of the period and the coefficient are 60 and 3.5,
respectively. Consequently, the default holdtime is 210 seconds.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic data_timeout Ar timer;
.Xc
Specifies the time after which (S,G) state for a silent source will be
deleted.
The default value is 210.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic register_suppression_timeout Ar interval;
.Xc
.Ar Interval
specifies the interval between receiving a Register-Stop and allowing
PIM Register to be send again.
The default value is 60.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic probe_time Ar timer;
.Xc
.Ar Timer
specifies the time between sending a null Register and the
Register-Suppression-Timer expiring unless it is restarted by
receiving a Register-Stop.
The default value is 5.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic assert_timeout Ar interval;
.Xc
.Ar Interval
specifies the interval between the last time an Assert is received and
the time at which the assert is timeout.
The default value is 180.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic cand_rp
.Op Ar interface
.Op Ic time Ar time
.Op Ic priority Ar priority
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specifies to act as a Candidate Rendezvous Point(RP).
It is recommended to specify
.Ic cand_rp
only in typical usage.
All other parameters are optional and will be set automatically.
If an
.Ar interface
is specified,
.Xr pim6sd 8
will search for a global address on the specified interface
and set the address in Candidate RP Advertisements.
An optional parameter
.Ic time
specifies the interval of two succeeding advertisements in seconds.
Its default value is 60.
2.5 *
.Ar time
will be set to Candidate-RP-Advertisement messages.
Another optional parameter
.Ic priority
specifies the priority of the RP.
The default value is 0, which means the highest priority.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic static_rp
.Ar prefix
.Ar address
.Op Ic priority Ar priority
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specifies a static group-to-RP mapping.  Necessary when there is a
IPv6 multicast router not understanding BSR message.
It cannot be specified with
.Ic cand_rp
or
.Ic cand_bsr
configuration.
.Pp
BSR function remains working independly of this option, so you can specify 
static group-to-RP mappings by this option while flodding BSR messages 
from upstream to downstreams, but cannot redistribute this static mapping
by BSR messages.
.Pp
If this option and BSR message provides a different RP for the same group,
the one with higher priority (i.e. smaller priority value) is chosen.  
If their priority is same, static one wins.
.Pp
An optional parameter
.Ic priority
specifies the priority of this static group-to-RP mapping.
Its default value is 0 (highest).
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic group_prefix Ar prefix;
.Xc
When acting as a Rendezvous Point(RP),
.Ar prefix
specifies a group prefix that the RP will handle.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic cand_bootstrap_router
.Op Ar interface
.Op Ic time Ar time
.Op Ic priority Ar priority
.Op Ic masklen Ar masklen
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specifies to act as a Candidate Bootstrap Router(BSR).
It is recommended to specify
.Ic cand_bootstrap_router
only in typical usage.
All other parameters are optional and will be set automatically.
If an
.Ar interface
is specified,
.Xr pim6sd 8
will search for a global address on the specified interface
and set the address in Bootstrap messages.
An optional parameter
.Ic time
specifies the interval of two succeeding bootstraps in seconds.
Its default value is 60.
Another optional parameter
.Ic priority
specifies the priority of the BSR.
The default value is 0, which means the lowest priority.
Hash mask length can also be specified by the
.Ic masklen
parameter. Its value,
.Ar masklen ,
must be no less than 0 and no greater than 128.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic switch_register_threshold Ic rate Ar rate Ic interval Ar interval;
.Xc
Specifies the threshold that a Rendezvous Point(RP) switches to a shortest
path tree, which is valid only when acting as an RP.
.Ic rate
specifies the threshold in bits per second, and
.Ic interval
specifies the interval of checking the rate in seconds.
The default values are 50000 and 20, respectively.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic switch_data_threshold Ic rate Ar rate Ic interval Ar interval;
.Xc
Specifies the threshold that a last hop router switches to a shortest
path tree.
.Ic rate
