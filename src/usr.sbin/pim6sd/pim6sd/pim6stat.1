.Sh NAME
.Nm pim6stat

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ds
.Op Fl f Ar dumpfile
.Op Fl p Ar pidfile
.Op Fl w Ar waitsec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
shows status or statistics of the PIM for IPv6 daemon currently running.
When invoked, it sends a signal to let the daemon dump its internal
status to a file, waits for dumping, and outputs the content of the file
to standard output.
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm Ns :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
specifies to show the status of a dense mode daemon (if running).
By default,
.Nm
assumes sparse mode.
.It Fl f
specifies the dumpfile to which the PIM daemon dumps its status.
.It Fl p
specifies the PID file of the currently running daemon.
.It Fl s
specifies to dump statistics instead of status (for sparse mode only).
.It Fl w
specifies the wait period in seconds between sending a signal to the
daemon and dumping the status or statistics to the dumpfile.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/pim6sd.pidX -compact
.It Pa /var/run/pim6sd.pid
The default PID file for a sparse mode daemon.
.It Pa /var/run/pim6dd.pid
The default PID file for a dense mode daemon.
.It Pa /var/run/pim6sd.dump
The default dump file for a sparse mode daemon.
.It Pa /var/run/pim6dd.dump
The default dump file for a dense mode daemon.
.It Pa /var/run/pim6sd.stat
The default statistics dump file for a sparse mode daemon.
