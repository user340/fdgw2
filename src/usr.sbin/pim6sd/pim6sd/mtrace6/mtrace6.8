.Sh NAME
.Nm mtrace6
.Nd print IPv6 multicast path from a source to
a receiver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar destination
.Op Fl g Ar gateway
.Op Fl h Ar hops
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl l Ar link
.Op Fl m Ar maxhops
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl r Ar response_addr
.Op Fl w Ar waittime
.Ar source
.Ar group
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
utilizes a tracing feature implemented in multicast routers that is
accessed via an extension to the MLD protocol. A trace query is
passed hop-by-hop along the reverse path from the
.Ar destination
to the
.Ar source ,
collecting hop addresses, packet counts, and routing error conditions
along the path, and then the response is returned to the requester.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar destination
Specifies the multicast receiver that the query wants to trace.
It is the host running
.Nm mtrace6
by default.
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Send the trace query via unicast directly to the multicast router
.Ar gateway .
A unicast router must be the last-hop router on the path from the
intended source to the receiver.
.Ar gateway
can also be a multicast address that the last hop router joins.
.It Fl h Ar hops
Set the query hop limit to
.Ar hops .
The default is 64.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specifies the local interface (on a multi-homed host) for sending
the trace query and for receiving responses.
.It Fl l Ar link
Specifies the link for the default first destination,
ff02::1,
of the trace query.
This option is effective only when the
.Fl g
option is not specified,
and cannot coexist with the option.
The
.Ar link
can be a numeric link identifier,
or the interface name on the link when there is one to one mapping
between links and interfaces.
.It Fl m Ar maxhops
Set to
.Ar maxhops
to the maximum number of hops that will be traced from the receiver
back toward the source. The default is 127 hops.
.It Fl n
Print hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numerically
(saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup for each router found on
the path).
.It Fl r Ar response_addr
Specify the host that the trace response sends to.
By default, the response will send to the host running
.Nm mtrace6 .
.It Fl w Ar waittime
Set the time to wait for a trace response to 
.Ar waittime
seconds. The default is 3 seconds.

.Sh BUGS
Multicast trace for IPv6 is experimental. MLD types for query and
response, and packet format are not officially defined.
.Pp
.Ar waittime
specified by the
.Fl w
option is currently meaningless.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mtrace6
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
