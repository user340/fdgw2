$KAME: README,v 1.2 2000/07/24 01:00:28 itojun Exp $

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
THIS RELEASE IS VERY ALPHA, SO PLEASE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE AND
DO NOT TRY IT OUTSIDE OF YOUR TESTBED.

This is README for pimd, the PIM multicast daemon.
PIM-SM version: 2
Check ftp://catarina.usc.edu/pub/pim/pimd/ for lastest version.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS: FreeBSD-2.2.*, SunOS-4.1.3, Solaris-2.5.1 and 2.6,
SGI, BSDI 3.0/3.1, NetBSD-1.3

AVAILABLE PIM kernel patches: FreeBSD-2.2.1, FreeBSD-2.2.2, FreeBSD-2.2,5,
		SunOS-4.1.3, SGI, BSDI-3.0, BSDI-3.1, NetBSD-1.3

Linux: pimd compiles under Linux, and linux-2.1.103 seems to have PIM-SMv2
kernel support, but I haven't tested whether the kernel patches really work.

FAST START (read "fast explanation" :))

1. Apply the PIM kernel patches, recompile, reboot

2. Copy pimd.conf to /etc and edit as appropriate. Disable the interfaces
you don't need. Note that you need at least 2 physical interfaces enabled.

3. Edit Makefile by uncommenting the line(s) corresponding to your platform.

4. Recompile pimd

5. Run pimd as a root. It is highly recommended to run it in debug mode.
Because there are many debug messages, you can specify only a subset of
the messages to be printed out:

usage: pimd [-c configfile] [-d [debug_level][,debug_level]]

Valid debug levels: dvmrp_prunes,dvmrp_mrt,dvmrp_neighbors,dvmrp_timers,igmp_proto,igmp_timers,igmp_members,trace,timeout,pkt,interfaces,kernel,cache,rsrr,pim_hello,pim_register,pim_join_prune,pim_bootstrap,pim_asserts,pim_cand_rp,pim_routes,pim_timers,pim_rpf

If you want to see all messages, use "pimd -d" only.

6. Note that it takes of the order of 30 seconds to 1 minute until the
Bootstrap router is elected and the RP-set distributed to the PIM routers,
and without the RP-set in the routers the multicast packets cannot be
forwarded.

7. There are plenty of bugs, some of them known (check BUGS.TODO),
some of them unknown, so your bug reports are more than welcome.
