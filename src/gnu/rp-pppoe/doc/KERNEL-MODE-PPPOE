RP-PPPoE now supports kernel-mode PPPoE on Linux kernels 2.4.x.  However,
the default "./go" build procedure does not make kernel-mode support.

Here's what you need to do:

1) Download Michal Ostrowski's patched version of pppd which supports
a PPPoE plugin.  The latest version as of this writing is
at http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mostrows/ in
http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mostrows/ppp-2.4.0-pppoe4.tgz.  It is
also mirrored at http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/

2) Unpack that version of pppd and build and install it.

3) In the rp-pppoe directory, change to src/ and type:

	./configure --enable-plugin=/path/to/ppp-tree

Here, /path/to/ppp-tree is where you unpacked the pppd software.  It
should be the directory named ppp-2.4.0.pppoe

4) Type make; make install

5) Edit /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf to include this line:

	LINUX_PLUGIN=/etc/ppp/plugins/rp-pppoe.so

6) Make sure your kernel was built with support for PPP, PPPOX and that
all modules are locatable by modprobe.  Make sure you have a /dev/ppp
device:

	mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0

After that, adsl-start should use kernel-mode PPPoE.

This code is experimental and unsupported.  Use at your own risk.
