#	WELCOME TO SQUID 2
#	------------------
#
#	This is the default Squid configuration file. You may wish
#	to look at the Squid home page (http://www.squid-cache.org/)
#	for the FAQ and other documentation.
#
#	The default Squid config file shows what the defaults for
#	various options happen to be.  If you don't need to change the
#	default, you shouldn't uncomment the line.  Doing so may cause
#	run-time problems.  In some cases "none" refers to no default
#	setting at all, while in other cases it refers to a valid
#	option - the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the
#	case.
#


# NETWORK OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: http_port
#	Usage:	port
#		hostname:port
#		1.2.3.4:port
#
#	The socket addresses where Squid will listen for HTTP client
#	requests.  You may specify multiple socket addresses.
#	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and
#	IP address with port.  If you specify a hostname or IP
#	address, then Squid binds the socket to that specific
#	address.  This replaces the old 'tcp_incoming_address'
#	option.  Most likely, you do not need to bind to a specific
#	address, so you can use the port number alone.
#
#	The default port number is 3128.
#
#	If you are running Squid in accelerator mode, then you
#	probably want to listen on port 80 also, or instead.
#
#	The -a command line option will override the *first* port
#	number listed here.   That option will NOT override an IP
#	address, however.
#
#	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines.
#
#Default:
# http_port 3128

#  TAG: icp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives ICP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  Default is 3130.  To disable use
#	"0".  May be overridden with -u on the command line.
#
#Default:
# icp_port 3130

#  TAG: htcp_port
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-htcp option
#
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives HTCP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  Default is 4827.  To disable use
#	"0".
#
#	To enable this option, you must use --enable-htcp with the
#	configure script.
#
#Default:
# htcp_port 4827

#  TAG: mcast_groups
#	This tag specifies a list of multicast groups which your server
#	should join to receive multicasted ICP queries.
#
#	NOTE!  Be very careful what you put here!  Be sure you
#	understand the difference between an ICP _query_ and an ICP
#	_reply_.  This option is to be set only if you want to RECEIVE
#	multicast queries.  Do NOT set this option to SEND multicast
#	ICP (use cache_peer for that).  ICP replies are always sent via
#	unicast, so this option does not affect whether or not you will
#	receive replies from multicast group members.
#
#	You must be very careful to NOT use a multicast address which
#	is already in use by another group of caches.
#
#	If you are unsure about multicast, please read the Multicast
#	chapter in the Squid FAQ (http://www.squid-cache.org/FAQ/).
#
#	Usage: mcast_groups 239.128.16.128 224.0.1.20
#
#	By default, Squid doesn't listen on any multicast groups.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: tcp_outgoing_address
#  TAG: udp_incoming_address
#  TAG: udp_outgoing_address
#	Usage: tcp_incoming_address 10.20.30.40
#	       udp_outgoing_address fully.qualified.domain.name
#
#	tcp_outgoing_address	is used for connections made to remote
#				servers and other caches.
#	udp_incoming_address	is used for the ICP socket receiving packets
#				from other caches.
#	udp_outgoing_address	is used for ICP packets sent out to other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	A *_incoming_address value of 0.0.0.0 indicates that Squid should
#	listen on all available interfaces.
#
#	If udp_outgoing_address is set to 255.255.255.255 (the default)
#	then it will use the same socket as udp_incoming_address. Only
#	change this if you want to have ICP queries sent using another
#	address than where this Squid listens for ICP queries from other
#	caches.
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use port 3130.
#
#	NOTE, tcp_incoming_address has been removed.  You can now
#	specify IP addresses on the 'http_port' line.
#
#Default:
# tcp_outgoing_address 255.255.255.255
# udp_incoming_address 0.0.0.0
# udp_outgoing_address 255.255.255.255


# OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE NEIGHBOR SELECTION ALGORITHM
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_peer
#	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:
#
#		cache_peer hostname type http_port icp_port
#
#	For example,
#
#	#                                        proxy  icp
#	#          hostname             type     port   port  options
#	#          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
#	cache_peer parent.foo.net       parent    3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#	cache_peer sib1.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#	cache_peer sib2.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#
#	      type:  either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.
#
#	proxy_port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
#		     requests.
#
#	  icp_port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
#		     objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
#		     specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
#		     neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
#		     enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.
#
#	    options: proxy-only
#		     weight=n
#		     ttl=n
#		     no-query
#		     default
#		     round-robin
#		     multicast-responder
#		     closest-only
#		     no-digest
#		     no-netdb-exchange
#		     no-delay
#		     login=user:password
#		     connect-timeout=nn
#		     digest-url=url
#		     allow-miss
#
#		     use 'proxy-only' to specify that objects fetched
#		     from this cache should not be saved locally.
#
#		     use 'weight=n' to specify a weighted parent.
#		     The weight must be an integer.  The default weight
#		     is 1, larger weights are favored more.
#
#		     use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
#		     when sending an ICP queries to this address.
#		     Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
#		     Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
#		     hosts, you must configure other group members as
#		     peers with the 'multicast-responder' option below.
#
#		     use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
#		     neighbor.
#
#		     use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
#		     be used as a "last-resort." You should probably
#		     only use 'default' in situations where you cannot
#		     use ICP with your parent cache(s).
#
#		     use 'round-robin' to define a set of parents which
#		     should be used in a round-robin fashion in the
#		     absence of any ICP queries.
#
#		     'multicast-responder' indicates that the named peer
#		     is a member of a multicast group.  ICP queries will
#		     not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP replies
#		     will be accepted from it.
#
#		     'closest-only' indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS
#		     replies, we'll only forward CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes
#		     and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.
#
#		     use 'no-digest' to NOT request cache digests from
#		     this neighbor.
#
#		     'no-netdb-exchange' disables requesting ICMP
#		     RTT database (NetDB) from the neighbor.
#
#		     use 'no-delay' to prevent access to this neighbor
#		     from influencing the delay pools.
#
#		     use 'login=user:password' if this is a personal/workgroup
#		     proxy and your parent requires proxy authentication.
#
#		     use 'connect-timeout=nn' to specify a peer
#		     specific connect timeout (also see the
#		     peer_connect_timeout directive)
#
#		     use 'digest-url=url' to tell Squid to fetch the cache
#		     digest (if digests are enabled) for this host from
#		     the specified URL rather than the Squid default
#		     location.
#
#		     use 'allow-miss' to disable Squid's use of only-if-cached
#		     when forwarding requests to siblings. This is primarily
#		     useful when icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. To
#		     extensive use of this option may result in forwarding
#		     loops, and you should avoid having two-way peerings
#		     with this option. (for example to deny peer usage on
#		     requests from peer by denying cache_peer_access if the
#		     source is a peer)
#
#	NOTE: non-ICP neighbors must be specified as 'parent'.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: cache_peer_domain
#	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be
#	queried.  Usage:
#
#	cache_peer_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
#	cache_peer_domain cache-host !domain
#
#	For example, specifying
#
#		cache_peer_domain parent.foo.net	.edu
#
#	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
#	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
#	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
#	with '!' means that the cache will be queried for objects
#	NOT in that domain.
#
#	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
#		  either on the same or separate lines.
#		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
#		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
#		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried
#		  for all requests.
#		* There are no defaults.
#		* There is also a 'cache_peer_access' tag in the ACL
#		  section.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: neighbor_type_domain
#	usage: neighbor_type_domain parent|sibling domain domain ...
#
#	Modifying the neighbor type for specific domains is now
#	possible.  You can treat some domains differently than the the
#	default neighbor type specified on the 'cache_peer' line.
#	Normally it should only be necessary to list domains which
#	should be treated differently because the default neighbor type
#	applies for hostnames which do not match domains listed here.
#
#EXAMPLE:
#	cache_peer  parent cache.foo.org 3128 3130
#	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .com .net
#	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .au .de
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally Squid will automatically determine an optimal ICP
#	query timeout value based on the round-trip-time of recent ICP
#	queries.  If you want to override the value determined by
#	Squid, set this 'icp_query_timeout' to a non-zero value.  This
#	value is specified in MILLISECONDS, so, to use a 2-second
#	timeout (the old default), you would write:
#
#		icp_query_timeout 2000
#
#Default:
# icp_query_timeout 0

#  TAG: maximum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very large values (say 5 seconds).
#	Use this option to put an upper limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#
#Default:
# maximum_icp_query_timeout 2000

#  TAG: mcast_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	For Multicast peers, Squid regularly sends out ICP "probes" to
#	count how many other peers are listening on the given multicast
#	address.  This value specifies how long Squid should wait to
#	count all the replies.  The default is 2000 msec, or 2
#	seconds.
#
#Default:
# mcast_icp_query_timeout 2000

#  TAG: dead_peer_timeout	(seconds)
#	This controls how long Squid waits to declare a peer cache
#	as "dead."  If there are no ICP replies received in this
#	amount of time, Squid will declare the peer dead and not
#	expect to receive any further ICP replies.  However, it
#	continues to send ICP queries, and will mark the peer as
#	alive upon receipt of the first subsequent ICP reply.
#
#	This timeout also affects when Squid expects to receive ICP
#	replies from peers.  If more than 'dead_peer' seconds have
#	passed since the last ICP reply was received, Squid will not
#	expect to receive an ICP reply on the next query.  Thus, if
#	your time between requests is greater than this timeout, you
#	will see a lot of requests sent DIRECT to origin servers
#	instead of to your parents.
#
#Default:
# dead_peer_timeout 10 seconds

#  TAG: hierarchy_stoplist
#	A list of words which, if found in a URL, cause the object to
#	be handled directly by this cache.  In other words, use this
#	to not query neighbor caches for certain objects.  You may
#	list this option multiple times.
#
#We recommend you to use at least the following line.
hierarchy_stoplist cgi-bin ?

#  TAG: no_cache
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, cause the reply to
#	immediately removed from the cache.  In other words, use this
#	to force certain objects to never be cached.
#
#	You must use the word 'DENY' to indicate the ACL names which should
#	NOT be cached.
#
#We recommend you to use the following two lines.
acl QUERY urlpath_regex cgi-bin \?
no_cache deny QUERY


# OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE CACHE SIZE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mem	(bytes)
#	NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS
#	SIZE.  IT PLACES A LIMIT ON ONE ASPECT OF SQUID'S MEMORY
#	USAGE.  SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER THINGS AS WELL.
#	YOUR PROCESS WILL PROBABLY BECOME TWICE OR THREE TIMES
#	BIGGER THAN THE VALUE YOU PUT HERE 
#
#	'cache_mem' specifies the ideal amount of memory to be used
#	for:
#		* In-Transit objects
#		* Hot Objects
#		* Negative-Cached objects
#
#	Data for these objects are stored in 4 KB blocks.  This
#	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
#	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
#	priority.
#
#	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
#	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
#	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
#	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
#	not needed for in-transit objects.
#
#	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
#	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
#	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
#	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
#	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
#	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
#	objects.
#
#Default:
# cache_mem 8 MB

#  TAG: cache_swap_low	(percent, 0-100)
#  TAG: cache_swap_high	(percent, 0-100)
#
#	The low- and high-water marks for cache object replacement.
#	Replacement begins when the swap (disk) usage is above the
#	low-water mark and attempts to maintain utilization near the
#	low-water mark.  As swap utilization gets close to high-water
#	mark object eviction becomes more aggressive.  If utilization is
#	close to the low-water mark less replacement is done each time.
#	
#	Defaults are 90% and 95%. If you have a large cache, 5% could be
#	hundreds of MB. If this is the case you may wish to set these
#	numbers closer together.
#
#Default:
# cache_swap_low 90
# cache_swap_high 95

#  TAG: maximum_object_size	(bytes)
#	Objects larger than this size will NOT be saved on disk.  The
#	value is specified in kilobytes, and the default is 4MB.  If
#	you wish to get a high BYTES hit ratio, you should probably
#	increase this (one 32 MB object hit counts for 3200 10KB
#	hits).  If you wish to increase speed more than your want to
#	save bandwidth you should leave this low.
#
#	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
#	this value to maximize the byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA!
#	See replacement_policy below for a discussion of this policy.
#
#Default:
# maximum_object_size 4096 KB

#  TAG: minimum_object_size	(bytes)
#	Objects smaller than this size will NOT be saved on disk.  The
#	value is specified in kilobytes, and the default is 0 KB, which
#	means there is no minimum.
#
#Default:
# minimum_object_size 0 KB

#  TAG: maximum_object_size_in_memory	(bytes)
#        Objects greater than this size will not be attempted to kept in
#        the memory cache. This should be set high enough to keep objects
#        accessed frequently in memory to improve performance whilst low
#        enough to keep larger objects from hoarding cache_mem .
#
#Default:
# maximum_object_size_in_memory 8 KB

#  TAG: ipcache_size	(number of entries)
#  TAG: ipcache_low	(percent)
#  TAG: ipcache_high	(percent)
#	The size, low-, and high-water marks for the IP cache.
#
#Default:
# ipcache_size 1024
# ipcache_low 90
# ipcache_high 95

#  TAG: fqdncache_size	(number of entries)
#	Maximum number of FQDN cache entries.
#
#Default:
# fqdncache_size 1024

#  TAG: cache_replacement_policy
#	The cache replacement policy parameter determines which
#	objects are evicted (replaced) when disk space is needed.
#
#	    lru       : Squid's original list based LRU policy
#	    heap GDSF : Greedy-Dual Size Frequency
#	    heap LFUDA: Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging
#	    heap LRU  : LRU policy implemented using a heap
#
#	Applies to any cache_dir lines listed below this.
#
#	The LRU policies keeps recently referenced objects.
#
#	The heap GDSF policy optimizes object hit rate by keeping smaller
#	popular objects in cache so it has a better chance of getting a
#	hit.  It achieves a lower byte hit rate than LFUDA though since
#	it evicts larger (possibly popular) objects.
#
#	The heap LFUDA policy keeps popular objects in cache regardless of
#	their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate at the expense of
#	hit rate since one large, popular object will prevent many
#	smaller, slightly less popular objects from being cached.
#
#	Both policies utilize a dynamic aging mechanism that prevents
#	cache pollution that can otherwise occur with frequency-based
#	replacement policies.
#
#	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
#	the value of maximum_object_size above its default of 4096 KB to
#	to maximize the potential byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA.  
#
#	For more information about the GDSF and LFUDA cache replacement
#	policies see http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/1999/HPL-1999-69.html
#	and http://fog.hpl.external.hp.com/techreports/98/HPL-98-173.html.
#
#Default:
# cache_replacement_policy lru

#  TAG: memory_replacement_policy
#	The memory replacement policy parameter determines which
#	objects are purged from memory when memory space is needed.
#
#	See cache_replacement_policy for details.
#
#Default:
# memory_replacement_policy lru


# LOGFILE PATHNAMES AND CACHE DIRECTORIES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_dir
#	Usage:
#	
#	cache_dir Type Directory-Name Fs-specific-data [options]
#
#	You can specify multiple cache_dir lines to spread the
#	cache among different disk partitions.
#
#	Type specifies the kind of storage system to use.  Most
#	everyone will want to use "ufs" as the type.  If you are using
#	Async I/O (--enable async-io) on Linux or Solaris, then you may
#	want to try "aufs" as the type.  Async IO support may be
#	buggy, however, so beware.
#
#	'Directory' is a top-level directory where cache swap
#	files will be stored.  If you want to use an entire disk
#	for caching, then this can be the mount-point directory.
#	The directory must exist and be writable by the Squid
#	process.  Squid will NOT create this directory for you.
#
#	The ufs store type:
#
#	"ufs" is the old well-known Squid storage format that has always
#	been there.
#
#	cache_dir ufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]
#
#	'Mbytes' is the amount of disk space (MB) to use under this
#	directory.  The default is 100 MB.  Change this to suit your
#	configuration.
#
#	'Level-1' is the number of first-level subdirectories which
#	will be created under the 'Directory'.  The default is 16.
#
#	'Level-2' is the number of second-level subdirectories which
#	will be created under each first-level directory.  The default
#	is 256.
#
#	The aufs store type:
#
#	"aufs" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing
#	POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
#	disk-I/O. This was formerly known in Squid as async-io.
#
#	cache_dir aufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]
#
#	see argument descriptions under ufs above
#
#	The diskd store type:
#
#	"diskd" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing a
#	separate process to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
#	disk-I/O.
#
#	cache_dir diskd Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options] [Q1=n] [Q2=n]
#
#	see argument descriptions under ufs above
#
#	Q1 specifies the number of unacknowledged I/O requests when Squid
#	stops opening new files. If this many messages are in the queues,
#	Squid won't open new files. Default is 64
#
#	Q2 specifies the number of unacknowledged messages when Squid
#	starts blocking.  If this many messages are in the queues,
#	Squid blocks until it recevies some replies. Default is 72
#
#	Common options:
#
#	read-only, this cache_dir is read only.
#
#	max-size=n, refers to the max object size this storedir supports.
#	It is used to initially choose the storedir to dump the object.
#	Note: To make optimal use of the max-size limits you should order
#	the cache_dir lines with the smallest max-size value first and the
#	ones with no max-size specification last.
#
#Default:
# cache_dir ufs /var/squid/cache 100 16 256

#  TAG: cache_access_log
#	Logs the client request activity.  Contains an entry for
#	every HTTP and ICP queries received.
#
#Default:
# cache_access_log /var/squid/logs/access.log

#  TAG: cache_log
#	Cache logging file. This is where general information about
#	your cache's behavior goes. You can increase the amount of data
#	logged to this file with the "debug_options" tag below.
#
#Default:
# cache_log /var/squid/logs/cache.log

#  TAG: cache_store_log
#	Logs the activities of the storage manager.  Shows which
#	objects are ejected from the cache, and which objects are
#	saved and for how long.  To disable, enter "none". There are
#	not really utilities to analyze this data, so you can safely
#	disable it.
#
#Default:
# cache_store_log /var/squid/logs/store.log

#  TAG: cache_swap_log
#	Location for the cache "swap.log."  This log file holds the
#	metadata of objects saved on disk.  It is used to rebuild the
#	cache during startup.  Normally this file resides in each
#	'cache_dir' directory, but you may specify an alternate
#	pathname here.  Note you must give a full filename, not just
#	a directory. Since this is the index for the whole object
#	list you CANNOT periodically rotate it!
#
#	If %s can be used in the file name then it will be replaced with a
#	a representation of the cache_dir name where each / is replaced
#	with '.'. This is needed to allow adding/removing cache_dir
#	lines when cache_swap_log is being used.
#	    
#	If have more than one 'cache_dir', and %s is not used in the name
#	then these swap logs will have names such as:
#
#		cache_swap_log.00
#		cache_swap_log.01
#		cache_swap_log.02
#
#	The numbered extension (which is added automatically)
#	corresponds to the order of the 'cache_dir' lines in this
#	configuration file.  If you change the order of the 'cache_dir'
#	lines in this file, then these log files will NOT correspond to
#	the correct 'cache_dir' entry (unless you manually rename
#	them).  We recommend that you do NOT use this option.  It is
#	better to keep these log files in each 'cache_dir' directory.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: emulate_httpd_log	on|off
#	The Cache can emulate the log file format which many 'httpd'
#	programs use.  To disable/enable this emulation, set
#	emulate_httpd_log to 'off' or 'on'.  The default
#	is to use the native log format since it includes useful
#	information that Squid-specific log analyzers use.
#
#Default:
# emulate_httpd_log off

#  TAG: log_ip_on_direct	on|off
#	Log the destination IP address in the hierarchy log tag when going
#	direct. Earlier Squid versions logged the hostname here. If you
#	prefer the old way set this to off.
#
#Default:
# log_ip_on_direct on

#  TAG: mime_table
#	Pathname to Squid's MIME table. You shouldn't need to change
#	this, but the default file contains examples and formatting
#	information if you do.
#
#Default:
# mime_table /etc/squid/mime.conf

#  TAG: log_mime_hdrs	on|off
#	The Cache can record both the request and the response MIME
#	headers for each HTTP transaction.  The headers are encoded
#	safely and will appear as two bracketed fields at the end of
#	the access log (for either the native or httpd-emulated log
#	formats).  To enable this logging set log_mime_hdrs to 'on'.
#
#Default:
# log_mime_hdrs off

#  TAG: useragent_log
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-useragent-log option
#
#	Squid will write the User-Agent field from HTTP requests
#	to the filename specified here.  By default useragent_log
#	is disabled.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: referer_log
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-referer-log option
#
#	Squid will write the Referer field from HTTP requests to the
#	filename specified here.  By default referer_log is disabled.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: pid_filename
#	A filename to write the process-id to.  To disable, enter "none".
#
#Default:
# pid_filename /var/squid/logs/squid.pid

#  TAG: debug_options
#	Logging options are set as section,level where each source file
#	is assigned a unique section.  Lower levels result in less
#	output,  Full debugging (level 9) can result in a very large
#	log file, so be careful.  The magic word "ALL" sets debugging
#	levels for all sections.  We recommend normally running with
#	"ALL,1".
#
#Default:
# debug_options ALL,1

#  TAG: log_fqdn	on|off
#	Turn this on if you wish to log fully qualified domain names
#	in the access.log. To do this Squid does a DNS lookup of all
#	IP's connecting to it. This can (in some situations) increase
#	latency, which makes your cache seem slower for interactive
#	browsing. 
#
#Default:
# log_fqdn off

#  TAG: client_netmask
#	A netmask for client addresses in logfiles and cachemgr output.
#	Change this to protect the privacy of your cache clients.
#	A netmask of 255.255.255.0 will log all IP's in that range with
#	the last digit set to '0'.
#
#Default:
# client_netmask 255.255.255.255


# OPTIONS FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: ftp_user
#	If you want the anonymous login password to be more informative
#	(and enable the use of picky ftp servers), set this to something
#	reasonable for your domain, like wwwuser@somewhere.net
#
#	The reason why this is domainless by default is that the
#	request can be made on the behalf of a user in any domain,
#	depending on how the cache is used.
#	Some ftp server also validate that the email address is valid
#	(for example perl.com).
#
#Default:
# ftp_user Squid@

#  TAG: ftp_list_width
#	Sets the width of ftp listings. This should be set to fit in
#	the width of a standard browser. Setting this too small
#	can cut off long filenames when browsing ftp sites.
#
#Default:
# ftp_list_width 32

#  TAG: ftp_passive
#	If your firewall does not allow Squid to use passive
#	connections, then turn off this option.
#
#Default:
# ftp_passive on

#  TAG: cache_dns_program
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --disable-internal-dns option
#
#	Specify the location of the executable for dnslookup process.
#
#Default:
# cache_dns_program /usr/pkg/libexec/

#  TAG: dns_children
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --disable-internal-dns option
#
#	The number of processes spawn to service DNS name lookups.
#	For heavily loaded caches on large servers, you should
#	probably increase this value to at least 10.  The maximum
#	is 32.  The default is 5.
#
#	You must have at least one dnsserver process.
#
#Default:
# dns_children 5

#  TAG: dns_retransmit_interval
#	Initial retransmit interval for DNS queries. The interval is
#	doubled each time all configured DNS servers have been tried.
#
#
#Default:
# dns_retransmit_interval 5 seconds

#  TAG: dns_timeout
#	DNS Query timeout. If no response is received to a DNS query
#	within this time then all DNS servers for the queried domain
#	is assumed to be unavailable.
#
#Default:
# dns_timeout 5 minutes

#  TAG: dns_defnames	on|off
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --disable-internal-dns option
#
#	Normally the 'dnsserver' disables the RES_DEFNAMES resolver
#	option (see res_init(3)).  This prevents caches in a hierarchy
#	from interpreting single-component hostnames locally.  To allow
#	dnsserver to handle single-component names, enable this
#	option.
#
#Default:
# dns_defnames off

#  TAG: dns_nameservers
#	Use this if you want to specify a list of DNS name servers
#	(IP addresses) to use instead of those given in your
#	/etc/resolv.conf file.
#
#	Example: dns_nameservers 10.0.0.1 192.172.0.4
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: diskd_program
#	Specify the location of the diskd executable.
#	Note that this is only useful if you have compiled in
#	diskd as one of the store io modules.
#
#Default:
# diskd_program /usr/pkg/libexec/diskd

#  TAG: unlinkd_program
#	Specify the location of the executable for file deletion process.
#
#Default:
# unlinkd_program /usr/pkg/libexec/unlinkd

#  TAG: pinger_program
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-icmp option
#
#	Specify the location of the executable for the pinger process.
#	This is only useful if you configured Squid (during compilation)
#	with the '--enable-icmp' option.
#
#Default:
# pinger_program /usr/pkg/libexec/

#  TAG: redirect_program
#	Specify the location of the executable for the URL redirector.
#	Since they can perform almost any function there isn't one included.
#	See the Release-Notes for information on how to write one.
#	By default, a redirector is not used.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: redirect_children
#	The number of redirector processes to spawn. If you start
#	too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of
#	URLs, slowing it down. If you start too many they will use RAM
#	and other system resources.
#
#Default:
# redirect_children 5

#  TAG: redirect_rewrites_host_header
#	By default Squid rewrites any Host: header in redirected
#	requests.  If you are running a accelerator then this may
#	not be a wanted effect of a redirector.
#
#Default:
# redirect_rewrites_host_header on

#  TAG: redirector_access
#	If defined, this access list specifies which requests are
#	sent to the redirector processes.  By default all requests
#	are sent.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: authenticate_program
#	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a
#	program reads a line containing "username password" and replies
#	"OK" or "ERR" in an endless loop.  If you use an authenticator,
#	make sure you have 1 acl of type proxy_auth.  By default, the
#	authenticator_program is not used.
#
#	If you want to use the traditional proxy authentication,
#	jump over to the ../auth_modules/NCSA directory and
#	type:
#		% make
#		% make install
#
#	Then, set this line to something like
#
#	authenticate_program /usr/pkg/bin/ncsa_auth /usr/pkg/etc/passwd
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: authenticate_children
#	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (default 5). If you
#	start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog
#	of usercode/password verifications, slowing it down. When password
#	verifications are done via a (slow) network you are likely to need
#	lots of authenticator processes.
#
#Default:
# authenticate_children 5

#  TAG: authenticate_ttl
#	The time a checked username/password combination remains cached.
#	If a wrong password is given for a cached user, the user gets
#	removed from the username/password cache forcing a revalidation.
#
#Default:
# authenticate_ttl 1 hour

#  TAG: authenticate_ip_ttl
#	With this option you control how long a proxy authentication
#	will be bound to a specific IP address. If a request using
#	the same user name is received during this time then access
#	will be denied and both users are required to reauthenticate
#	them selves.  The idea behind this is to make it annoying
#	for people to share their password to their friends, but
#	yet allow a dialup user to reconnect on a different dialup
#	port.
#
#	The default is 0 to disable the check. Recommended value
#	if you have dialup users are no more than 60 seconds to allow
#	the user to redial without hassle. If all your users are
#	stationary then higher values may be used.
#
#	See also authenticate_ip_ttl_is_strict
#
#Default:
# authenticate_ip_ttl 0 seconds

#  TAG: authenticate_ip_ttl_is_strict
#	This option makes authenticate_ip_ttl a bit stricted. With this
#	enabled authenticate_ip_ttl will deny all access from other IP
#	addresses until the TTL has expired, and the IP address "owning"
#	the userid will not be forced to reauthenticate.
#
#Default:
# authenticate_ip_ttl_is_strict on


# OPTIONS FOR TUNING THE CACHE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: wais_relay_host
#  TAG: wais_relay_port
#	Relay WAIS request to host (1st arg) at port (2 arg).
#
#Default:
# wais_relay_port 0

#  TAG: request_header_max_size	(KB)
#	This specifies the maximum size for HTTP headers in a request.
#	Request headers are usually relatively small (about 512 bytes).
#	Placing a limit on the request header size will catch certain
#	bugs (for example with persistent connections) and possibly
#	buffer-overflow or denial-of-service attacks.
#
#Default:
# request_header_max_size 10 KB

#  TAG: request_body_max_size	(KB)
#	This specifies the maximum size for an HTTP request body.
#	In other words, the maximum size of a PUT/POST request.
#	A user who attempts to send a request with a body larger
#	than this limit receives an "Invalid Request" error message.
#	If you set this parameter to a zero, there will be no limit
#	imposed.
#
#Default:
# request_body_max_size 1 MB

#  TAG: reply_body_max_size	(KB)
#	This option specifies the maximum size of a reply body.  It
#	can be used to prevent users from downloading very large files,
#	such as MP3's and movies.   The reply size is checked twice.
#	First when we get the reply headers, we check the
#	content-length value.  If the content length value exists and
#	is larger than this parameter, the request is denied and the
#	user receives an error message that says "the request or reply
#	is too large." If there is no content-length, and the reply
#	size exceeds this limit, the client's connection is just closed
#	and they will receive a partial reply.
#
#	NOTE: downstream caches probably can not detect a partial reply
#	if there is no content-length header, so they will cache
#	partial responses and give them out as hits.  You should NOT
#	use this option if you have downstream caches.
#
#	If you set this parameter to zero (the default), there will be
#	no limit imposed.
#
#Default:
# reply_body_max_size 0

#  TAG: refresh_pattern
#	usage: refresh_pattern [-i] regex min percent max [options]
#
#	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.  To make
#	them case-insensitive, use the -i option.
#
#	'Min' is the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit
#	expiry time should be considered fresh. The recommended
#	value is 0, any higher values may cause dynamic applications
#	to be erroneously cached unless the application designer
#	has taken the appropriate actions.
#
#	'Percent' is a percentage of the objects age (time since last
#	modification age) an object without explicit expiry time
#	will be considered fresh.
#
#	'Max' is an upper limit on how long objects without an explicit
#	expiry time will be considered fresh.
#
#	options: overrsde-expire
#		 override-lastmod
#		 reload-into-ims
#		 ignore-reload
#
#		override-expire enforces min age even if the server
#		sent a Expires: header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP
#		standard.  Enabling this feature could make you liable
#		for problems which it causes.
#
#		override-lastmod enforces min age even on objects
#		that was modified recently.
#
#		reload-into-ims changes client no-cache or ``reload''
#		to If-Modified-Since requests. Doing this VIOLATES the
#		HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-reload ignores a client no-cache or ``reload''
#		header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling
#		this feature could make you liable for problems which
#		it causes.
#		
#	Please see the file doc/Release-Notes-1.1.txt for a full
#	description of Squid's refresh algorithm.  Basically a
#	cached object is: (the order is changed from 1.1.X)
#
#		FRESH if expires < now, else STALE
#		STALE if age > max
#		FRESH if lm-factor < percent, else STALE
#		FRESH if age < min
#		else STALE
#
#	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.
#	The first entry which matches is used.  If none of the entries
#	match, then the default will be used.
#
#	Note, you must uncomment all the default lines if you want
#	to change one. The default setting is only active if none is
#	used.
#
#Default:
# refresh_pattern ^ftp:		1440	20%	10080
# refresh_pattern ^gopher:	1440	0%	1440
# refresh_pattern .		0	20%	4320

#  TAG: reference_age
#	As a part of normal operation, Squid performs Least Recently
#	Used removal of cached objects.  The LRU age for removal is
#	computed dynamically, based on the amount of disk space in
#	use.  The dynamic value can be seen in the Cache Manager 'info'
#	output.
#
#	The 'reference_age' parameter defines the maximum LRU age.  For
#	example, setting reference_age to '1 week' will cause objects
#	to be removed if they have not been accessed for a week or
#	more.  The default value is one year.
#
#	Specify a number here, followed by units of time.  For example:
#		1 week
#		3.5 days
#		4 months
#		2.2 hours
#
#	NOTE: this parameter is not used when using the enhanced
#	replacement policies, GDSH or LFUDA.
#
#Default:
# reference_age 1 year

#  TAG: quick_abort_min	(KB)
#  TAG: quick_abort_max	(KB)
#  TAG: quick_abort_pct	(percent)
#	The cache can be configured to continue downloading aborted
#	requests.  This may be undesirable on slow (e.g. SLIP) links
#	and/or very busy caches.  Impatient users may tie up file
#	descriptors and bandwidth by repeatedly requesting and
#	immediately aborting downloads.
#
#	When the user aborts a request, Squid will check the
#	quick_abort values to the amount of data transfered until
#	then.
#
#	If the transfer has less than 'quick_abort_min' KB remaining,
#	it will finish the retrieval.  Setting 'quick_abort_min' to -1
#	will disable the quick_abort feature.
#
#	If the transfer has more than 'quick_abort_max' KB remaining,
#	it will abort the retrieval.
#
#	If more than 'quick_abort_pct' of the transfer has completed,
#	it will finish the retrieval.
#
#Default:
# quick_abort_min 16 KB
# quick_abort_max 16 KB
# quick_abort_pct 95

#  TAG: negative_ttl	time-units
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for failed requests.  Certain types of
#	failures (such as "connection refused" and "404 Not Found") are
#	negatively-cached for a configurable amount of time.  The
#	default is 5 minutes.  Note that this is different from
#	negative caching of DNS lookups.
#
#Default:
# negative_ttl 5 minutes

#  TAG: positive_dns_ttl	time-units
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for positive caching of successful DNS lookups.
#	Default is 6 hours (360 minutes).  If you want to minimize the
#	use of Squid's ipcache, set this to 1, not 0.
#
#Default:
# positive_dns_ttl 6 hours

#  TAG: negative_dns_ttl	time-units
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for negative caching of failed DNS lookups.
#
#Default:
# negative_dns_ttl 5 minutes

#  TAG: range_offset_limit	(bytes)
#	Sets a upper limit on how far into the the file a Range request
#	may be to cause Squid to prefetch the whole file. If beyond this
#	limit then Squid forwards the Range request as it is and the result
#	is NOT cached.
#
#	This is to stop a far ahead range request (lets say start at 17MB)
#	from making Squid fetch the whole object up to that point before
#	sending anything to the client.
#
#	A value of -1 causes Squid to always fetch the object from the
#	beginning so that it may cache the result. (2.0 style)
#
#	A value of 0 causes Squid to never fetch more than the
#	client requested. (default)
#
#Default:
# range_offset_limit 0 KB


# TIMEOUTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: connect_timeout	time-units
#	Some systems (notably Linux) can not be relied upon to properly
#	time out connect(2) requests.  Therefore the Squid process
#	enforces its own timeout on server connections.  This parameter
#	specifies how long to wait for the connect to complete.  The
#	default is two minutes (120 seconds).
#
#Default:
# connect_timeout 2 minutes

#  TAG: peer_connect_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for a pending TCP
#	connection to a peer cache.  The default is 30 seconds.   You
#	may also set different timeout values for individual neighbors
#	with the 'connect-timeout' option on a 'cache_peer' line.
#
#Default:
# peer_connect_timeout 30 seconds

#  TAG: siteselect_timeout	time-units
#	For URN to multiple URL's URL selection
#
#Default:
# siteselect_timeout 4 seconds

#  TAG: read_timeout	time-units
#	The read_timeout is applied on server-side connections.  After
#	each successful read(), the timeout will be extended by this
#	amount.  If no data is read again after this amount of time,
#	the request is aborted and logged with ERR_READ_TIMEOUT.  The
#	default is 15 minutes.
#
#Default:
# read_timeout 15 minutes

#  TAG: request_timeout
#	How long to wait for an HTTP request after connection
#	establishment.  For persistent connections, wait this long
#	after the previous request completes.
#
#Default:
# request_timeout 30 seconds

#  TAG: client_lifetime	time-units
#	The maximum amount of time that a client (browser) is allowed to
#	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
#	from having a lot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
#	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
#	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
#	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is one
#	day, 1440 minutes.
#
#	NOTE:  The default value is intended to be much larger than any
#	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
#	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.
#	If you seem to have many client connections tying up
#	filedescriptors, we recommend first tuning the read_timeout,
#	request_timeout, pconn_timeout and quick_abort values.
#
#Default:
# client_lifetime 1 day

#  TAG: half_closed_clients
#	Some clients may shutdown the sending side of their TCP
#	connections, while leaving their receiving sides open.	Sometimes,
#	Squid can not tell the difference between a half-closed and a
#	fully-closed TCP connection.  By default, half-closed client
#	connections are kept open until a read(2) or write(2) on the
#	socket returns an error.  Change this option to 'off' and Squid
#	will immediately close client connections when read(2) returns
#	"no more data to read."
#
#Default:
# half_closed_clients on

#  TAG: pconn_timeout
#	Timeout for idle persistent connections to servers and other
#	proxies.
#
#Default:
# pconn_timeout 120 seconds

#  TAG: ident_timeout
#	Maximum time to wait for IDENT requests.  If this is too high,
#	and you enabled 'ident_lookup', then you might be susceptible
#	to denial-of-service by having many ident requests going at
#	once.
#
#	Only src type ACL checks are fully supported.  A src_domain
#	ACL might work at times, but it will not always provide
#	the correct result.
#
#	This option may be disabled by using --disable-ident with
#	the configure script.
#
#Default:
# ident_timeout 10 seconds

#  TAG: shutdown_lifetime	time-units
#	When SIGTERM or SIGHUP is received, the cache is put into
#	"shutdown pending" mode until all active sockets are closed.
#	This value is the lifetime to set for all open descriptors
#	during shutdown mode.  Any active clients after this many
#	seconds will receive a 'timeout' message.
#
#Default:
# shutdown_lifetime 30 seconds


# ACCESS CONTROLS

#  TAG: http_access
#	Allowing or Denying access based on defined access lists
#
#	Access to the HTTP port:
#	http_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	NOTE on default values:
#
#	If there are no "access" lines present, the default is to deny
#	the request.
#
#	If none of the "access" lines cause a match, the default is the
#	opposite of the last line in the list.  If the last line was
#	deny, then the default is allow.  Conversely, if the last line
#	is allow, the default will be deny.  For these reasons, it is a
#	good idea to have an "deny all" or "allow all" entry at the end
#	of your access lists to avoid potential confusion.
#
#Default:
# http_access deny all
#
#Recommended minimum configuration:
#
# Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow manager localhost
http_access deny manager
# Deny requests to unknown ports
http_access deny !Safe_ports
# Deny CONNECT to other than SSL ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
#
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
#
# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access deny all

#  TAG: icp_access
#	Allowing or Denying access to the ICP port based on defined
#	access lists
#
#	icp_access  allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	See http_access for details
#
#Default:
# icp_access deny all
#
#Allow ICP queries from eveyone
icp_access allow all

#  TAG: miss_access
#	Use to force your neighbors to use you as a sibling instead of
#	a parent.  For example:
#
#		acl localclients src 172.16.0.0/16
#		miss_access allow localclients
#		miss_access deny  !localclients
#
#	This means that only your local clients are allowed to fetch
#	MISSES and all other clients can only fetch HITS.
#
#	By default, allow all clients who passed the http_access rules
#	to fetch MISSES from us.
#
#Default setting:
# miss_access allow all

#  TAG: cache_peer_access
#	Similar to 'cache_peer_domain' but provides more flexibility by
#	using ACL elements.
#
#	cache_peer_access cache-host allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	The syntax is identical to 'http_access' and the other lists of
#	ACL elements.  See the comments for 'http_access' below, or
#	the Squid FAQ (http://www.squid-cache.org/FAQ/FAQ-10.html).
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: proxy_auth_realm
#	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the client for
#	proxy authentication (part of the text the user will see when
#	prompted their username and password).
#
#Default:
# proxy_auth_realm Squid proxy-caching web server

#  TAG: ident_lookup_access
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, cause an ident
#	(RFC 931) lookup to be performed for this request.  For
#	example, you might choose to always perform ident lookups
#	for your main multi-user Unix boxes, but not for your Macs
#	and PCs.  By default, ident lookups are not performed for
#	any requests.
#
#	To enable ident lookups for specific client addresses, you
#	can follow this example:
# 
#	acl ident_aware_hosts src 198.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
#	ident_lookup_access allow ident_aware_hosts
#	ident_lookup_access deny all
#
#	This option may be disabled by using --disable-ident with
#	the configure script.
#
#Default:
# ident_lookup_access deny all


# ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mgr
#	Email-address of local cache manager who will receive
#	mail if the cache dies.  The default is "webmaster."
#
#Default:
# cache_mgr webmaster

#  TAG: cache_effective_user
#  TAG: cache_effective_group
#
#	If the cache is run as root, it will change its effective/real
#	UID/GID to the UID/GID specified below.  The default is to
#	change to UID to nobody and GID to nogroup.
#
#	If Squid is not started as root, the default is to keep the
#	current UID/GID.  Note that if Squid is not started as root then
#	you cannot set http_port to a value lower than 1024.
#
#Default:
# cache_effective_user nobody
# cache_effective_group nogroup

#  TAG: visible_hostname
#	If you want to present a special hostname in error messages, etc,
#	then define this.  Otherwise, the return value of gethostname()
#	will be used. If you have multiple caches in a cluster and
#	get errors about IP-forwarding you must set them to have individual
#	names with this setting.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: unique_hostname
#	If you want to have multiple machines with the same
#	'visible_hostname' then you must give each machine a different
#	'unique_hostname' so that forwarding loops can be detected.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: hostname_aliases
#	A list of other DNS names that your cache has.
#
#Default:
# none


# OPTIONS FOR THE CACHE REGISTRATION SERVICE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	This section contains parameters for the (optional) cache
#	announcement service.  This service is provided to help
#	cache administrators locate one another in order to join or
#	create cache hierarchies.
#
#	An 'announcement' message is sent (via UDP) to the registration
#	service by Squid.  By default, the announcement message is NOT
#	SENT unless you enable it with 'announce_period' below.
#
#	The announcement message includes your hostname, plus the
#	following information from this configuration file:
#
#		http_port
#		icp_port
#		cache_mgr
#
#	All current information is processed regularly and made
#	available on the Web at http://www.ircache.net/Cache/Tracker/.

#  TAG: announce_period
#	This is how frequently to send cache announcements.  The
#	default is `0' which disables sending the announcement
#	messages.
#
#	To enable announcing your cache, just uncomment the line
#	below.
#
#Default:
# announce_period 0
#
#To enable announcing your cache, just uncomment the line below.
#announce_period 1 day

#  TAG: announce_host
#  TAG: announce_file
#  TAG: announce_port
#	announce_host and announce_port set the hostname and port
#	number where the registration message will be sent.
#
#	Hostname will default to 'tracker.ircache.net' and port will
#	default default to 3131.  If the 'filename' argument is given,
#	the contents of that file will be included in the announce
#	message.
#
#Default:
# announce_host tracker.ircache.net
# announce_port 3131


# HTTPD-ACCELERATOR OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: httpd_accel_host
#  TAG: httpd_accel_port
#	If you want to run Squid as an httpd accelerator, define the
#	host name and port number where the real HTTP server is.
#
#	If you want virtual host support then specify the hostname
#	as "virtual".
#
#	If you want virtual port support then specify the port as "0".
#
#	NOTE: enabling httpd_accel_host disables proxy-caching and
#	ICP.  If you want these features enabled also, then set
#	the 'httpd_accel_with_proxy' option.
#
#Default:
# httpd_accel_port 80

#  TAG: httpd_accel_single_host	on|off
#	If you are running Squid as a accelerator and have a single backend
#	server then set this to on. This causes Squid to forward the request
#	to this server irregardles of what any redirectors or Host headers
#	says.
#
#	Leave this at off if you have multiple backend servers, and use a
#	redirector (or host table or private DNS) to map the requests to the
#	appropriate backend servers. Note that the mapping needs to be a
#	1-1 mapping between requested and backend (from redirector) domain
#	names or caching will fail, as cacing is performed using the
#	URL returned from the redirector.
#
#	See also redirect_rewrites_host_header.
#
#Default:
# httpd_accel_single_host off

#  TAG: httpd_accel_with_proxy	on|off
#	If you want to use Squid as both a local httpd accelerator
#	and as a proxy, change this to 'on'. Note however that your
#	proxy users may have trouble to reach the accelerated domains
#	unless their browsers are configured not to use this proxy for
#	those domains (for example via the no_proxy browser configuration
#	setting)
#
#Default:
# httpd_accel_with_proxy off

#  TAG: httpd_accel_uses_host_header	on|off
#	HTTP/1.1 requests include a Host: header which is basically the
#	hostname from the URL.  Squid can be an accelerator for
#	different HTTP servers by looking at this header.  However,
#	Squid does NOT check the value of the Host header, so it opens
#	a big security hole.  We recommend that this option remain
#	disabled unless you are sure of what you are doing.
#
#	However, you will need to enable this option if you run Squid
#	as a transparent proxy.  Otherwise, virtual servers which
#	require the Host: header will not be properly cached.
#
#Default:
# httpd_accel_uses_host_header off


# MISCELLANEOUS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: dns_testnames
#	The DNS tests exit as soon as the first site is successfully looked up
#
#	This test can be disabled with the -D command line option.
#
#Default:
# dns_testnames netscape.com internic.net nlanr.net microsoft.com

#  TAG: logfile_rotate
#	Specifies the number of logfile rotations to make when you
#	type 'squid -k rotate'.  The default is 10, which will rotate
#	with extensions 0 through 9.  Setting logfile_rotate to 0 will
#	disable the rotation, but the logfiles are still closed and
#	re-opened.  This will enable you to rename the logfiles
#	yourself just before sending the rotate signal.
#
#	Note, the 'squid -k rotate' command normally sends a USR1
#	signal to the running squid process.  In certain situations
#	(e.g. on Linux with Async I/O), USR1 is used for other
#	purposes, so -k rotate uses another signal.  It is best to get
#	in the habit of using 'squid -k rotate' instead of 'kill -USR1
#	<pid>'.
#
#Default:
# logfile_rotate 10

#  TAG: append_domain
#	Appends local domain name to hostnames without any dots in
#	them.  append_domain must begin with a period.
#
#Example:
# append_domain .yourdomain.com
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: tcp_recv_bufsize	(bytes)
#	Size of receive buffer to set for TCP sockets.  Probably just
#	as easy to change your kernel's default.  Set to zero to use
#	the default buffer size.
#
#Default:
# tcp_recv_bufsize 0 bytes

#  TAG: err_html_text
#	HTML text to include in error messages.  Make this a "mailto"
#	URL to your admin address, or maybe just a link to your
#	organizations Web page.
#
#	To include this in your error messages, you must rewrite
#	the error template files (found in the "errors" directory).
#	Wherever you want the 'err_html_text' line to appear,
#	insert a %L tag in the error template file.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: deny_info
#	Usage:   deny_info err_page_name acl
#	Example: deny_info ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED bad_guys
#
#	This can be used to return a ERR_ page for requests which
#	do not pass the 'http_access' rules.  A single ACL will cause
#	the http_access check to fail.  If a 'deny_info' line exists
#	for that ACL then Squid returns a corresponding error page.
#
#	You may use ERR_ pages that come with Squid or create your own pages
#	and put them into the configured errors/ directory.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: memory_pools	on|off
#	If set, Squid will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory
#	available for future use.  If memory is a premium on your
#	system and you believe your malloc library outperforms Squid 
#	routines, disable this.
#
#Default:
# memory_pools on

#  TAG: memory_pools_limit	(bytes)
#	Used only with memory_pools on:
#	memory_pools_limit 50 MB
#
#	If set to a non-zero value, Squid will keep at most the specified
#	limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools. All free()
#	requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc
#	library. Squid does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps
#	objects that otherwise would be free()d. Thus, it is safe to set
#	memory_pools_limit to a reasonably high value even if your
#	configuration will use less memory.
#
#	If not set (default) or set to zero, Squid will keep all memory it
#	can. That is, there will be no limit on the total amount of memory
#	used for safe-keeping.
#
#	To disable memory allocation optimization, do not set
#	memory_pools_limit to 0. Set memory_pools to "off" instead.
#
#	An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
#	when the limit is checked. This overhead is close to four bytes per
#	object kept. However, pools may actually _save_ memory because of
#	reduced memory thrashing in your malloc library.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: forwarded_for	on|off
#	If set, Squid will include your system's IP address or name
#	in the HTTP requests it forwards.  By default it looks like
#	this:
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.2.3
#
#	If you disable this, it will appear as
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: unknown
#
#Default:
# forwarded_for on

#  TAG: log_icp_queries	on|off
#	If set, ICP queries are logged to access.log. You may wish
#	do disable this if your ICP load is VERY high to speed things
#	up or to simplify log analysis.
#
#Default:
# log_icp_queries on

#  TAG: icp_hit_stale	on|off
#	If you want to return ICP_HIT for stale cache objects, set this
#	option to 'on'.  If you have sibling relationships with caches
#	in other administrative domains, this should be 'off'.  If you only
#	have sibling relationships with caches under your control, then
#	it is probably okay to set this to 'on'.
#
#Default:
# icp_hit_stale off

#  TAG: minimum_direct_hops
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many hops away.
#
#Default:
# minimum_direct_hops 4

#  TAG: minimum_direct_rtt
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many rtt milliseconds away.
#
#Default:
# minimum_direct_rtt 400

#  TAG: cachemgr_passwd
#	Specify passwords for cachemgr operations.
#
#	Usage: cachemgr_passwd password action action ...
#
#	Some valid actions are (see cache manager menu for a full list):
#		5min
#		60min
#		asndb
#		authenticator
#		cbdata
#		client_list
#		comm_incoming
#		config *
#		counters
#		delay
#		digest_stats
#		dns
#		events
#		filedescriptors
#		fqdncache
#		histograms
#		http_headers
#		info
#		io
#		ipcache
#		mem
#		menu
#		netdb
#		non_peers
#		objects
#		pconn
#		peer_select
#		redirector
#		refresh
#		server_list
#		shutdown *
#		store_digest
#		storedir
#		utilization
#		via_headers
#		vm_objects
#
#	* Indicates actions which will not be performed without a
#	  valid password, others can be performed if not listed here.
#
#	To disable an action, set the password to "disable".
#	To allow performing an action without a password, set the
#	password to "none".
#
#	Use the keyword "all" to set the same password for all actions.
#
#Example:
# cachemgr_passwd secret shutdown
# cachemgr_passwd lesssssssecret info stats/objects
# cachemgr_passwd disable all
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: store_avg_object_size	(kbytes)
#	Average object size, used to estimate number of objects your
#	cache can hold.  See doc/Release-Notes-1.1.txt.  The default is
#	13 KB.
#
#Default:
# store_avg_object_size 13 KB

#  TAG: store_objects_per_bucket
#	Target number of objects per bucket in the store hash table.
#	Lowering this value increases the total number of buckets and
#	also the storage maintenance rate.  The default is 50.
#
#Default:
# store_objects_per_bucket 20

#  TAG: client_db	on|off
#	If you want to disable collecting per-client statistics, then
#	turn off client_db here.
#
#Default:
# client_db on

#  TAG: netdb_low
#  TAG: netdb_high
#	The low and high water marks for the ICMP measurement
#	database.  These are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	900 and 1000.  When the high water mark is reached, database
#	entries will be deleted until the low mark is reached.
#
#Default:
# netdb_low 900
# netdb_high 1000

#  TAG: netdb_ping_period
#	The minimum period for measuring a site.  There will be at
#	least this much delay between successive pings to the same
#	network.  The default is five minutes.
#
#Default:
# netdb_ping_period 5 minutes

#  TAG: query_icmp	on|off
#	If you want to ask your peers to include ICMP data in their ICP
#	replies, enable this option.
#
#	If your peer has configured Squid (during compilation) with
#	'--enable-icmp' then that peer will send ICMP pings to origin server
#	sites of the URLs it receives.  If you enable this option then the
#	ICP replies from that peer will include the ICMP data (if available).
#	Then, when choosing a parent cache, Squid will choose the parent with
#	the minimal RTT to the origin server.  When this happens, the
#	hierarchy field of the access.log will be
#	"CLOSEST_PARENT_MISS".  This option is off by default.
#
#Default:
# query_icmp off

#  TAG: test_reachability	on|off
#	When this is 'on', ICP MISS replies will be ICP_MISS_NOFETCH
#	instead of ICP_MISS if the target host is NOT in the ICMP
#	database, or has a zero RTT.
#
#Default:
# test_reachability off

#  TAG: buffered_logs	on|off
#	Some log files (cache.log, useragent.log) are written with
#	stdio functions, and as such they can be buffered or
#	unbuffered.  By default they will be unbuffered. Buffering them
#	can speed up the writing slightly (though you are unlikely to
#	need to worry).
#
#Default:
# buffered_logs off

#  TAG: reload_into_ims	on|off
#	When you enable this option, client no-cache or ``reload''
#	requests will be changed to If-Modified-Since requests.
#	Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this
#	feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#	
#	see also refresh_pattern for a more selective approach.
#
#	This option may be disabled by using --disable-http-violations
#	with the configure script.
#
#Default:
# reload_into_ims off

#  TAG: always_direct
#	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
#	ALWAYS be forwarded directly to origin servers.  For example,
#	to always directly forward requests for local servers use
#	something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	To always forward FTP requests directly, use
#
#		acl FTP proto FTP
#		always_direct allow FTP
#
#	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
#	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
#	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
#	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
#	some other rule.  Example:
#
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		acl local-servers dstdomain  foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	This option replaces some v1.1 options such as local_domain
#	and local_ip.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: never_direct
#	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
#	the description for always_direct if you have not already.
#
#	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
#	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
#	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
#	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain foo.net
#		acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
#		never_direct deny local-servers
#		never_direct allow all
#	
#	or if squid is inside a firewall and there is local intranet
#	servers inside the firewall then use something like:
#
#		acl local-intranet dstdomain foo.net
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-intranet
#		never_direct allow all
#	
#	This option replaces some v1.1 options such as inside_firewall
#	and firewall_ip.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: anonymize_headers
#	Usage: anonymize_headers allow|deny header_name ...
#
#	This option replaces the old 'http_anonymizer' option with
#	something that is much more configurable.  You may now
#	specify exactly which headers are to be allowed, or which
#	are to be removed from outgoing requests.
#
#	There are two methods of using this option.  You may either
#	allow specific headers (thus denying all others), or you
#	may deny specific headers (thus allowing all others).
#
#	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
#	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:
#
#		anonymize_headers deny From Referer Server
#		anonymize_headers deny User-Agent WWW-Authenticate Link
#		
#	Or, to reproduce the old 'http_anonymizer paranoid' feature
#	you should use:
#
#		anonymize_headers allow Allow Authorization Cache-Control
#		anonymize_headers allow Content-Encoding Content-Length
#		anonymize_headers allow Content-Type Date Expires Host
#		anonymize_headers allow If-Modified-Since Last-Modified
#		anonymize_headers allow Location Pragma Accept
#		anonymize_headers allow Accept-Encoding Accept-Language
#		anonymize_headers allow Content-Language Mime-Version
#		anonymize_headers allow Retry-After Title Connection
#		anonymize_headers allow Proxy-Connection
#
#	NOTE: You can not mix "allow" and "deny".  All 'anonymize_headers'
#	lines must have the same second argument.
#
#	By default, all headers are allowed (no anonymizing is
#	performed).
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: fake_user_agent
#	If you filter the User-Agent header with 'anonymize_headers' it
#	may cause some Web servers to refuse your request.  Use this to
#	fake one up.  For example:
#
#	fake_user_agent Nutscrape/1.0 (CP/M; 8-bit)
#	(credit to Paul Southworth pauls@etext.org for this one!)
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icon_directory
#	Where the icons are stored. These are normally kept in
#	/etc/squid/icons
#
#Default:
# icon_directory /etc/squid/icons

#  TAG: error_directory
#	If you wish to create your own versions of the default
#	(English) error files, either to customize them to suit your
#	language or company copy the template English files to another
#	directory and point this tag at them.
#
#Default:
# error_directory /etc/squid/errors

#  TAG: minimum_retry_timeout	(seconds)
#	This specifies the minimum connect timeout, for when the
#	connect timeout is reduced to compensate for the availability
#	of multiple IP addresses.
#
#	When a connection to a host is initiated, and that host has
#	several IP addresses, the default connection timeout is reduced
#	by dividing it by the number of addresses.  So, a site with 15
#	addresses would then have a timeout of 8 seconds for each
#	address attempted.  To avoid having the timeout reduced to the
#	point where even a working host would not have a chance to
#	respond, this setting is provided.  The default, and the
#	minimum value, is five seconds, and the maximum value is sixty
#	seconds, or half of connect_timeout, whichever is greater and
#	less than connect_timeout.
#
#Default:
# minimum_retry_timeout 5 seconds

#  TAG: maximum_single_addr_tries
#	This sets the maximum number of connection attempts for a
#	host that only has one address (for multiple-address hosts,
#	each address is tried once).
#
#	The default value is three tries, the (not recommended)
#	maximum is 255 tries.  A warning message will be generated
#	if it is set to a value greater than ten.
#
#Default:
# maximum_single_addr_tries 3

#  TAG: snmp_port
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-snmp option
#
#	Squid can now serve statistics and status information via SNMP.
#	By default it listens to port 3401 on the machine. If you don't
#	wish to use SNMP, set this to "0".
#
#	NOTE: SNMP support requires use the --enable-snmp configure
#	command line option.
#
#Default:
# snmp_port 3401

#  TAG: snmp_access
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-snmp option
#
#	Allowing or denying access to the SNMP port.
#
#	All access to the agent is denied by default.
#	usage:
#
#	snmp_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#Example:
# snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
# snmp_access deny all
#
#Default:
# snmp_access deny all

#  TAG: snmp_incoming_address
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-snmp option
#
#  TAG: snmp_outgoing_address
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-snmp option
#
#	Just like 'udp_incoming_address' above, but for the SNMP port.
#
#	snmp_incoming_address	is used for the SNMP socket receiving
#				messages from SNMP agents.
#	snmp_outgoing_address	is used for SNMP packets returned to SNMP
#				agents.
#
#	The default snmp_incoming_address (0.0.0.0) is to listen on all
#	available network interfaces.
#
#	If snmp_outgoing_address is set to 255.255.255.255 (the default)
#	then it will use the same socket as snmp_incoming_address. Only
#	change this if you want to have SNMP replies sent using another
#	address than where this Squid listens for SNMP queries.
#
#	NOTE, snmp_incoming_address and snmp_outgoing_address can not have
#	the same value since they both use port 3401.
#
#Default:
# snmp_incoming_address 0.0.0.0
# snmp_outgoing_address 255.255.255.255

#  TAG: as_whois_server
#	WHOIS server to query for AS numbers.  NOTE: AS numbers are
#	queried only when Squid starts up, not for every request.
#
#Default:
# as_whois_server whois.ra.net
# as_whois_server whois.ra.net

#  TAG: wccp_router
#	Use this option to define your WCCP ``home'' router for
#	Squid.   Setting the 'wccp_router' to 0.0.0.0 (the default)
#	disables WCCP.
#
#Default:
# wccp_router 0.0.0.0

#  TAG: wccp_version
#	According to some users, Cisco IOS 11.2 only supports WCCP
#	version 3.  If you're using that version of IOS, change
#	this value to 3.
#
#Default:
# wccp_version 4

#  TAG: wccp_incoming_address
#  TAG: wccp_outgoing_address
#        wccp_incoming_address   Use this option if you require WCCP
#				messages to be received on only one
#				interface.  Do NOT use this option if
#				you're unsure how many interfaces you
#				have, or if you know you have only one
#				interface.
#
#	wccp_outgoing_address	Use this option if you require WCCP
#				messages to be sent out on only one
#				interface.  Do NOT use this option if
#				you're unsure how many interfaces you
#				have, or if you know you have only one
#				interface.
#
#        The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#        NOTE, wccp_incoming_address and wccp_outgoing_address can not have
#        the same value since they both use port 2048.

# DELAY POOL PARAMETERS (all require DELAY_POOLS compilation option)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: delay_pools
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools option
#
#	This represents the number of delay pools to be used.  For example,
#	if you have one class 2 delay pool and one class 3 delays pool, you
#	have a total of 2 delay pools.
#
#	To enable this option, you must use --enable-delay-pools with the
#	configure script.
#
#Default:
# delay_pools 0

#  TAG: delay_class
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools option
#
#	This defines the class of each delay pool.  There must be exactly one
#	delay_class line for each delay pool.  For example, to define two
#	delay pools, one of class 2 and one of class 3, the settings above
#	and here would be:
#
#Example:
# delay_pools 2      # 2 delay pools
# delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
# delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
#
#	The delay pool classes are:
#
#		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket.
#
#		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
#				from bits 25 through 32 of the IP address.
#
#		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
#				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
#				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
#				32 of the IP address.
#
#	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
#		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
#		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
#		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_access
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools option
#
#	This is used to determine which delay pool a request falls into.
#	The first matched delay pool is always used, i.e., if a request falls
#	into delay pool number one, no more delay are checked, otherwise the
#	rest are checked in order of their delay pool number until they have
#	all been checked.  For example, if you want some_big_clients in delay
#	pool 1 and lotsa_little_clients in delay pool 2:
#
#Example:
# delay_access 1 allow some_big_clients
# delay_access 1 deny all
# delay_access 2 allow lotsa_little_clients
# delay_access 2 deny all
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_parameters
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools option
#
#	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
#	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
#	description of delay_class.  For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:
#
#delay_parameters pool aggregate
#
#	For a class 2 delay pool:
#
#delay_parameters pool aggregate individual
#
#	For a class 3 delay pool:
#
#delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual
#
#	The variables here are:
#
#		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
#				number specified in delay_pools as used in
#				delay_class lines.
#
#		aggregate	the "delay parameters" for the aggregate bucket
#				(class 1, 2, 3).
#
#		individual	the "delay parameters" for the individual
#				buckets (class 2, 3).
#
#		network		the "delay parameters" for the network buckets
#				(class 3).
#
#	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
#	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
#	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
#	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.
#
#	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
#	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64kbps
#	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:
#
#delay_parameters 1 -1/-1 8000/8000
#
#	Note that the figure -1 is used to represent "unlimited".
#
#	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
#	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256kbps (strict limit)
#	with each 8-bit network permitted 64kbps (strict limit) and each
#	individual host permitted 4800bps with a bucket maximum size of 64kb
#	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
#	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
#	large downloads more significantly:
#
#delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000
#
#	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-100)
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-delay-pools option
#
#	The initial bucket percentage is used to determine how much is put
#	in each bucket when squid starts, is reconfigured, or first notices
#	a host accessing it (in class 2 and class 3, individual hosts and
#	networks only have buckets associated with them once they have been
#	"seen" by squid).
#
#Default:
# delay_initial_bucket_level 50

#  TAG: incoming_icp_average
#  TAG: incoming_http_average
#  TAG: incoming_dns_average
#  TAG: min_icp_poll_cnt
#  TAG: min_dns_poll_cnt
#  TAG: min_http_poll_cnt
#	Heavy voodoo here.  I can't even believe you are reading this.
#	Are you crazy?  Don't even think about adjusting these unless
#	you understand the algorithms in comm_select.c first!
#
#Default:
# incoming_icp_average 6
# incoming_http_average 4
# incoming_dns_average 4
# min_icp_poll_cnt 8
# min_dns_poll_cnt 8
# min_http_poll_cnt 8

#  TAG: max_open_disk_fds
#	To avoid having disk as the I/O bottleneck Squid can optionally
#	bypass the on-disk cache if more than this amount of disk file
#	descriptors are open.
#
#	A value of 0 indicates no limit.
#
#Default:
# max_open_disk_fds 0

#  TAG: offline_mode
#	Enable this option and Squid will never try to validate cached
#	objects.
#
#Default:
# offline_mode off

#  TAG: uri_whitespace
#	What to do with requests that have whitespace characters in the
#	URI.  Options:
#
#	strip:  The whitespace characters are stripped out of the URL.
#		This is the behavior recommended by RFC2616.
#	deny:   The request is denied.  The user receives an "Invalid
#		Request" message.
#	allow:  The request is allowed and the URI is not changed.  The
#		whitespace characters remain in the URI.  Note the
#		whitespace is passed to redirector processes if they
#		are in use.
#	encode:	The request is allowed and the whitespace characters are
#		encoded according to RFC1738.  This could be considered
#		a violation of the HTTP/1.1
#		RFC because proxies are not allowed to rewrite URI's.
#	chop:	The request is allowed and the URI is chopped at the
#		first whitespace.  This might also be considered a
#		violation.
#
#Default:
# uri_whitespace strip

#  TAG: broken_posts
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, causes Squid to send
#	a extra CRLF pair after the body of a PUT/POST request.
#
#	Some HTTP servers has broken implementations of PUT/POST,
#	and rely on a extra CRLF pair sent by some WWW clients.
#
#	Quote from RFC 2068 section 4.1 on this matter:
#
#	  Note: certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate an
#	  extra CRLF's after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly
#	  forbidden by the BNF, an HTTP/1.1 client must not preface or follow
#	  a request with an extra CRLF.
#
#Example:
# acl buggy_server url_regex ^http://....
# broken_posts allow buggy_server
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: mcast_miss_addr
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM option
#
#	If you enable this option, every "cache miss" URL will
#	be sent out on the specified multicast address.
#
#	Do not enable this option unless you are are absolutely
#	certain you understand what you are doing.
#
#Default:
# mcast_miss_addr 255.255.255.255

#  TAG: mcast_miss_ttl
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_TTL option
#
#	This is the time-to-live value for packets multicasted
#	when multicasting off cache miss URLs is enabled.  By
#	default this is set to 'site scope', i.e. 16.
#
#Default:
# mcast_miss_ttl 16

#  TAG: mcast_miss_port
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM option
#
#	This is the port number to be used in conjunction with
#	'mcast_miss_addr'.
#
#Default:
# mcast_miss_port 3135

#  TAG: mcast_miss_encode_key
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM option
#
#	The URLs that are sent in the multicast miss stream are
#	encrypted.  This is the encryption key.
#
#Default:
# mcast_miss_encode_key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#  TAG: nonhierarchical_direct
#	By default, Squid will send any non-hierarchical requests
#	(matching hierarchy_stoplist or not cachable request type) direct
#	to origin servers.
#
#	If you set this to off, then Squid will prefer to send these
#	requests to parents.
#
#	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only
#	add latency to these request without any improvement in global hit
#	ratio.
#
#	If you are inside an firewall then see never_direct instead of
#	this directive.
#
#Default:
# nonhierarchical_direct on

#  TAG: prefer_direct
#	Normally Squid tries to use parents for most requests. If you by some
#	reason like it to first try going direct and only use a parent if
#	going direct fails then set this to off.
#
#	By combining nonhierarchical_direct off and prefer_direct on you
#	can set up Squid to use a parent as a backup path if going direct
#	fails.
#
#Default:
# prefer_direct off

#  TAG: strip_query_terms
#	By default, Squid strips query terms from requested URLs before
#	logging.  This protects your user's privacy.
#
#Default:
# strip_query_terms on

#  TAG: coredump_dir
#	By default Squid leaves core files in the first cache_dir
#	directory.  If you set 'coredump_dir' to a directory
#	that exists, Squid will chdir() to that directory at startup
#	and coredump files will be left there.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: redirector_bypass
#	When this is 'on', a request will not go through the
#	redirector if all redirectors are busy.  If this is 'off'
#	and the redirector queue grows too large, Squid will exit
#	with a FATAL error and ask you to increase the number of
#	redirectors.  You should only enable this if the redirectors
#	are not critical to your caching system.  If you use
#	redirectors for access control, and you enable this option,
#	then users may have access to pages that they should not
#	be allowed to request.
#
#Default:
# redirector_bypass off

#  TAG: ignore_unknown_nameservers
#	By default Squid checks that DNS responses are received
#	from the same IP addresses that they are sent to.  If they
#	don't match, Squid ignores the response and writes a warning
#	message to cache.log.  You can allow responses from unknown
#	nameservers by setting this option to 'off'.
#
#Default:
# ignore_unknown_nameservers on

#  TAG: digest_generation
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-cache-digests option
#
#	This controls whether the server will generate a Cache Digest
#	of its contents.  By default, Cache Digest generation is
#	enabled if Squid is compiled with USE_CACHE_DIGESTS defined.
#
#Default:
# digest_generation on

#  TAG: digest_bits_per_entry
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-cache-digests option
#
#	This is the number of bits of the server's Cache Digest which
#	will be associated with the Digest entry for a given HTTP
#	Method and URL (public key) combination.  The default is 5.
#
#Default:
# digest_bits_per_entry 5

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_period	(seconds)
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-cache-digests option
#
#	This is the number of seconds between Cache Digest rebuilds.
#
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_rewrite_period	(seconds)
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-cache-digests option
#
#	This is the number of seconds between Cache Digest writes to
#	disk.
#
#Default:
# digest_rewrite_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_swapout_chunk_size	(bytes)
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-cache-digests option
#
#	This is the number of bytes of the Cache Digest to write to
#	disk at a time.  It defaults to 4096 bytes (4KB), the Squid
#	default swap page.
#
#Default:
# digest_swapout_chunk_size 4096 bytes

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage	(percent, 0-100)
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-cache-digests option
#
#	This is the percentage of the Cache Digest to be scanned at a
#	time.  By default it is set to 10% of the Cache Digest.
#
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage 10

#  TAG: chroot
#	Use this to have Squid do a chroot() while initializing.  This
#	also causes Squid to fully drop root privileges after
#	initializing.  This means, for example, that if you use a HTTP
#	port less than 1024 and try to reconfigure, you will get an
#	error.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: client_persistent_connections
#  TAG: server_persistent_connections
#	Persistent connection support for clients and servers.  By
#	default, Squid uses persistent connections (when allowed)
#	with its clients and servers.  You can use these options to
#	disable persistent connections with clients and/or servers.
#
#Default:
# client_persistent_connections on
# server_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: pipeline_prefetch
#	To boost the performance of pipelined requests to closer
#	match that of a non-proxied environment Squid tries to fetch
#	up to two requests in parallell from a pipeline.
#
#Default:
# pipeline_prefetch on

#  TAG: extension_methods
#	Squid only knows about standardized HTTP request methods.
#	You can add up to 20 additional "extension" methods here.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: high_response_time_warning	(msec)
#	If the one-minute median response time exceeds this value,
#	Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get the
#	administrators attention.  The value is in milliseconds.
#
#Default:
# high_response_time_warning 0

#  TAG: high_page_fault_warning
#	If the one-minute average page fault rate exceeds this
#	value, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.  The value is in page faults
#	per second.
#
#Default:
# high_page_fault_warning 0

#  TAG: high_memory_warning
#	If the memory usage (as determined by mallinfo) exceeds
#	value, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.
#
#Default:
# high_memory_warning 0

#  TAG: store_dir_select_algorithm
#	Set this to 'round-robin' as an alternative.
#
#Default:
# store_dir_select_algorithm least-load

#  TAG: forward_log
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DWIP_FWD_LOG option
#
#	Logs the server-side requests.
#
#	This is currently work in progress.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: ie_refresh	on|off
#	Microsoft Internet Explorer up until version 5.5 Service
#	Pack 1 has an issue with transparent proxies, wherein it
#	is impossible to force a refresh.  Turning this on provides
#	a partial fix to the problem, by causing all IMS-REFRESH
#	requests from older IE versions to check the origin server
#	for fresh content.  This reduces hit ratio by some amount
#	(~10% in my experience), but allows users to actually get
#	fresh content when they want it.  Note that because Squid
#	cannot tell if the user is using 5.5 or 5.5SP1, the behavior
#	of 5.5 is unchanged from old versions of Squid (i.e. a
#	forced refresh is impossible).  Newer versions of IE will,
#	hopefully, continue to have the new behavior and will be
#	handled based on that assumption.  This option defaults to
#	the old Squid behavior, which is better for hit ratios but
#	worse for clients using IE, if they need to be able to
#	force fresh content.
#
#Default:
# ie_refresh off
